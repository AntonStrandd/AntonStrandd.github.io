      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a recent graduate in game development with focus on programming.
         My experience comes from Unity and C#. 
         I'm passionate about creating engaging, functional experiences and continuously expanding my technical skills.
         What drives me the most is problem solving,finding creative solutions to complex problems, and I'm always looking forward to learn something new. </p>

          <h3>Astro Plunder</h3>
          <p>A stylized FPS where the player takes the role of a space pirate.
            I was responsible for implementing the weapon system, which enhanced my knowledge of design patterns
            and component-based architecture within Unity and C#.

          <h3>Crew of Two</h3>
          <p>Play as Augusta and Hastings as they live the fantastical story of their grandma as she tells them of her young days as a pirate on the Killick Ocean.
             Work together to fight off enemy ships, endure the approaching storm and whatever the storm might bring.
            I was responsible for the interaction system and to create the co-op aspects of the game. It was challenging but very fun to work at,
            it was also the first time working in a lager scale group of 12 people!

          <h3>Steering AI</h3>
          <p>This was a project that i made to learn about game AI and steering, it helped me with cohesion, coupling and component based programming principles.
            The red lines on the agent detects collisions and applies a force away from it to be able to steer. They do also have a group behaviour so you can control
            multiple agents at the same time.

          <h3>Frog's Garbage Grab</h3>
          <p>A game about a frog who's goal is to platform through the swamps and clean it up.
            This was my first project in a team, where i was responsible for all the programming and implementing in the game.
            This taught me alot about communication and how to work in a team.
